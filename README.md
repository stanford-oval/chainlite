## Installation

ChainLite has been tested with Python 3.10. To install, do the following:


1. Install ChainLite via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install chainlite
   ```
   or
    ```bash
    pip install https://github.com/stanford-oval/chainlite.git
    ```


1. Copy `llm_config.yaml` to your project and follow the instructions there to update it with your own configuration.

## Usage

Before you can use Chainlite, you can call the following function to load the configuration file. If you don't, ChainLite will use `llm_config.yaml` in the current directory (the directory you are running your script from) by default.

```python
from chainlite import load_config_file
load_config_file("./llm_config.yaml") # The path should be relative to the directory you run the script from, usually the root directory of your project
```

Make sure the corresponding API keys are set in environment variables with the name you specified in the configuration file, e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY` etc.

Then you can use the following functions in your code:

```python
llm_generation_chain(
    template_file: str,
    engine: str,
    max_tokens: int,
    temperature: float = 0.0,
    stop_tokens=None,
    top_p: float = 0.9,
    output_json: bool = False,
    template_blocks: list[tuple[str]]=None,
    keep_indentation: bool = False,
    progress_bar_desc: Optional[str] = None,
    tools: Optional[List[Callable]] = None,
    force_tool_calling: bool = False,
    additional_postprocessing_runnable: Runnable = None,
    bind_prompt_values: Dict = {},
) # returns a LangChain chain the accepts inputs and returns a string as output
load_config_from_file(config_file: str)
pprint_chain() # can be used to print inputs or outputs of a LangChain chain.
write_prompt_logs_to_file(log_file: Optional[str]) # writes all instructions, inputs and outputs of all your LLM API calls to a jsonl file. Good for debugging or collecting data using LLMs
get_total_cost() # returns the total cost of all LLM API calls you have made. Resets each time you run your code.
```

## Full Example

`joke.prompt` with a 1-shot example:

```markdown
# instruction
Tell a joke about the input topic. The format of the joke should be a question and response, separated by a line break.
{# This is a comment, and will be ignored anywhere in a .prompt file. Other than block definitions and comments, '#' is allowed and is treated as a normal character.  #}

# distillation instruction
Tell a joke.

# input
Physics

# output
Why don't scientists trust atoms?
Because they make up everything!

# input
{{ topic }}
```

`main.py`:
```python
from chainlite import load_config_file
load_config_file("./chainlite_config.yaml")

async def tell_joke(topic: str):
    response = await llm_generation_chain(
        template_file="joke.prompt",
        engine="gpt-35-turbo",
        max_tokens=100,
    ).ainvoke({"topic": topic})
    print(response)

asyncio.run(tell_joke("Life as a PhD student")) # prints "Why did the PhD student bring a ladder to the library?\nTo take their research to the next level!"
write_prompt_logs_to_file("llm_input_outputs.jsonl")
```

Then you will have `llm_input_outputs.jsonl`:
```json
{"template_name": "joke.prompt", "instruction": "Tell a joke.", "input": "Life as a PhD student", "output": "Why did the PhD student bring a ladder to the library?\nTo take their research to the next level!"}
```

For more examples, see `tests/test_llm_generate.py`

## Configuration

The `chainlite_config.yaml` file allows you to customize the behavior of ChainLite. Modify the file to set your preferences for the LangChain and LiteLLM integrations.

## Syntax Highlighting
